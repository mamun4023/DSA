Points to remember


The static keyword is used to declare a static method.
The static method can be of any name.
A class can contain more than one static method.
If we declare more than one static method with a similar name, the JavaScript always invokes the last one.
The static method can be used to create utility functions.
We can use this keyword to call a static method within another static method.
We cannot use this keyword directly to call a static method within the non-static method. In such case, we can call the static method either using the class name or as the property of the constructor.
