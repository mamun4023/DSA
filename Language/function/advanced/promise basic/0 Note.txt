Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. 


Benefits of Promises:
	Improves Code Readability
	Better handling of asynchronous operations
	Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
	Better Error Handling


A Promise has four states:
	fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
	rejected: Action related to the promise failed
	pending: Promise is still pending i.e not fulfilled or rejected yet
	settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected


A promise can be created using Promise constructor.
Syntax

var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
     //do something
});



Parameters :
	Promise constructor takes only one argument,a callback function.
	Callback function takes two arguments, resolve and reject
	Perform operations inside the callback function and if everything went well then call resolve.
	If desired operations do not go well then call reject
